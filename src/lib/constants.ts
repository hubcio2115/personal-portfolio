export const WHOIS_MESSAGE = `Hey, I'm Hubert! üëãüèª
I'm a software developer and uni CS student, who likes to build engaging websites like this one
After graduating I'd like to continue my strive in frontend development and I'm looking forward to
see how it will turn out.
By this point I got opportunities to work at some software houses via multiple internship programs.
I also created a lot of projects relating different areas of computer science, such is the way of a
university student.
I'm working on exploring new things about web dev by trying new tools, learning about new things and
trying to implement them. Like this site. It uses Astro, a web framework for hosting static web pages.
It introduces ideas that I was not thought at uni, like islands architecture, the idea of MPA and many more!
Now I'm looking for more opportunities to spread my wings and learn from veterans in the field. Also I'm on the
last stretch of my Bachelor's degree.

I hope you'll find this little web page I made on a whim fun to interact with!`;

# Personal Portfolio

Hello 👋🏻,

this is the repository of my portfolio terminal themed web site. You can explore the code freely if you so wish to.
If you navigated here through my github 😳 here is a [link](https://personal-portfolio-one-tan.vercel.app/) to the site.

The site is written with Astro, tailwindcss and VanillaJS.
I had a lot of fun building it.
